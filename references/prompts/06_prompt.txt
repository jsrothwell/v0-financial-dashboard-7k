Fix UI bugs in financial dashboard and add income, bill, and savings goal entry features
I have a financial tracker dashboard with the following issues that need to be fixed:
1. Income vs Expenses Section - Layout Bug:

The circular progress indicators showing "Spent Budget" ($3,500), "Safe to Spend" ($4,129), and "Total Budget" ($9,304.29) have numbers breaking out of their containers
Fix by reducing font sizes for the currency values to ensure they fit within their designated spaces
Prefer using text-sm or text-xs for the dollar amounts instead of text wrapping
Ensure proper spacing and padding within each circular card
The labels should remain readable while the numbers scale down as needed

2. Add Manual Income Entry Feature:

Add a button (e.g., "+ Add Income") near the top of the dashboard or in the Income vs Expenses section
When clicked, open a modal/dialog with a form containing:

Amount input field (number)
Description/source field (text) - e.g., "Freelance project", "Side gig"
Date picker (default to today)
Category dropdown (optional) - e.g., "Freelance", "Bonus", "Investment", "Other"
Submit and Cancel buttons


Upon submission, update the Total Balance and reflect the new income in the dashboard
Show a success toast notification after adding income

3. Make "Add Bill" Button Functional:

The existing "+ Add Bill" button currently does nothing - make it functional
When clicked, open a modal/dialog with a form containing:

Bill name/description field (text) - e.g., "Netflix", "Electric bill"
Amount input field (number)
Due date picker
Recurring frequency dropdown - options: "One-time", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Yearly"
Category dropdown - e.g., "Utilities", "Subscriptions", "Insurance", "Rent", "Other"
Payment status toggle - "Paid" or "Unpaid"
Submit and Cancel buttons


Upon submission, add the bill to the "Recent by Category" section under the appropriate category
Update the expense totals and budget calculations
Show a success toast notification after adding the bill

4. Make "Add Savings Goal" Button Functional:

The existing button for adding savings goals currently does nothing - make it functional
When clicked, open a modal/dialog with a form containing:

Goal name field (text) - e.g., "Emergency Fund", "Vacation", "New Car"
Target amount input field (number)
Current amount/starting balance input field (number, default to 0)
Target date picker (optional)
Description field (optional, textarea)
Submit and Cancel buttons


Upon submission, add the new savings goal to the savings goals section
Show progress bar and percentage toward goal
Show a success toast notification after adding the goal
Include ability to add money to existing goals

Design requirements:

Maintain the current teal/turquoise color scheme (#14B8A6 or similar)
Keep the clean, modern aesthetic with proper spacing
Ensure all text is legible and properly contained within components
Use Tailwind CSS classes with proper responsive sizing (text-xs, text-sm, text-base)
Make sure number formatting includes proper currency symbols and comma separators
All modals should have a backdrop overlay and close button (X)
Forms should have proper validation (required fields, positive numbers for amounts)
Use consistent button styling across all modals

Please generate the updated component with these fixes and all new functionality.
