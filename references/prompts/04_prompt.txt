Create a prominent card on the main dashboard that shows:
1. Monthly Budget Summary:
   - Total Monthly Budget (e.g., $3,500)
   - Total Spent This Month (e.g., $2,847)
   - Remaining Budget (with color: green if good, yellow if warning, red if over)
   - Progress bar showing spent/total percentage
   
2. Budget Status Indicator:
   - Large visual status: "On Track" (green) or "Over Budget" (red) or "Warning" (yellow)
   - Icon to represent status (checkmark, warning triangle, alert)

BUDGET BY CATEGORY CARD:
Create a detailed card showing budget breakdown by category:
1. Category List with Progress Bars:
   Each category shows:
   - Category name with icon (Housing, Food, Transportation, Entertainment, etc.)
   - Progress bar (visual representation of spent vs budgeted)
   - Spent amount / Budgeted amount (e.g., "$450 / $600")
   - Percentage used (e.g., "75%")
   - Color coding:
     * Green: Under 75% of budget
     * Yellow: 75-100% of budget
     * Red: Over 100% of budget
   - Small trend indicator (up/down arrow compared to last month)

2. Category Details (hover or expand):
   - Number of transactions in category this month
   - Average transaction size
   - Comparison to last month

3. Visual Elements:
   - Use horizontal progress bars with rounded corners
   - Show percentage inside or next to bar
   - Stack categories vertically
   - Most over-budget categories at top (prioritized view)

BUDGET SETTINGS PAGE/MODAL:
Create a Budget Settings screen (accessible from dashboard):
1. Set Monthly Budget by Category:
   - List all categories
   - Input field for budget amount per category
   - Toggle to enable/disable category
   - "Add Custom Category" button
   - Total monthly budget calculated automatically at bottom

2. Budget Templates:
   - Quick start templates (50/30/20 rule, Zero-based, Custom)
   - One-click to apply template

   - budgets: Array of { category: string, budgeted: number, spent: number, enabled: boolean }
   - totalBudget: number (sum of all category budgets)
   - totalSpent: number (sum of all transactions this month)
   - remaining: number (totalBudget - totalSpent)

2. Sample Budget Data:

   - Transportation: $300 budgeted, $245 spent (82% - yellow)
   - Entertainment: $200 budgeted, $280 spent (140% - red)
   - Shopping: $400 budgeted, $275 spent (69% - green)
   - Utilities: $200 budgeted, $185 spent (93% - yellow)
   - Healthcare: $150 budgeted, $0 spent (0% - green)
   - Other: $450 budgeted, $212 spent (47% - green)

3. Calculations:

   - Update budget card immediately after transaction is saved
   - Show warning if transaction will put category over budget

2. Connect to Demo Mode:
   - When demo mode is ON, show sample budget data
   - When demo mode is OFF, show user's actual budget or empty state

3. Dashboard Layout:
   - Add Budget Overview Card after the main balance/spending cards
   - Add Budget by Category Card below that (or in a separate tab)
   - Keep layout responsive (single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop)

VISUAL DESIGN:
- Use consistent card styling from existing dashboard
- Progress bars should be prominent and easy to scan
- Color scheme:
  * Green: #10B981 (good, under budget)
  * Yellow: #F59E0B (warning, approaching limit)
  * Red: #EF4444 (alert, over budget)

EMPTY STATES:
- If no budget set: Show "Set Your First Budget" CTA with template options
- If category has no transactions: Show $0 spent with encouraging message
