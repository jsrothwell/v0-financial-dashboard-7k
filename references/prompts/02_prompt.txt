IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Store auth state in React Context
- Use localStorage for: auth token (mock), cookie consent, demo mode preference
- Sample data should be a separate data file that's loaded when demo mode is ON
- Add smooth transitions between demo and real data
- Settings should save immediately (no save button needed) or use "Save Changes" button
- Form validation with helpful error messages

SAMPLE DATA FOR DEMO MODE:
When demo mode is enabled, load:
- 50+ sample transactions across 3 months
- Various categories with realistic spending patterns
- Budget data showing some categories over/under budget
- Net worth around $15,000-$25,000
- Mix of income and expenses

DEMO MODE INDICATOR:
When demo mode is active, show a dismissible banner at top of dashboard:
"🎭 Demo Mode Active - Viewing sample data. Go to Settings to use your real data."

Make all forms accessible with proper labels, validation, and error handling. Use shadcn/ui components for consistency.

## Tips for Implementation

**Order of Implementation:**
1. Start with Authentication (most critical)
2. Add Cookie Consent (quick win)
3. Create Legal Pages (can use templates)
4. Build Settings Page last (most complex)

**For Demo Data:**
After v0 generates the settings page, you can refine with:
\`\`\`
"Make the demo data more realistic with 100 transactions spanning 6 months"
"Add a visual indicator badge next to the logo when in demo mode"
"Create an onboarding flow for new users that suggests enabling demo mode first"
\`\`\`

**For Cookie Consent:**
\`\`\`
"Make the cookie banner slide up from bottom with animation"
"Add a 'Customize' modal that lets users choose cookie categories"
"Ensure banner is accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)"
\`\`\`

**Testing Prompt:**
\`\`\`
"Add a testing mode where I can quickly switch between logged in/out states"
"Show me both the empty state (new user) and populated state (with data)"
