Fix navigation issue on the Settings page:

PROBLEM: Users cannot return to the dashboard from the Settings page.

ADD THE FOLLOWING NAVIGATION OPTIONS:

1. Back Button (Top Left):
   - Add a "← Back to Dashboard" button or link in the top left of the Settings page
   - Or use a simple "← Back" button
   - Should navigate to the main dashboard route
   - Use lucide-react ArrowLeft icon

2. Persistent Header/Navigation:
   - Ensure the main navigation header stays visible on the Settings page
   - Include logo/app name that's clickable (goes to dashboard)
   - Keep the user dropdown menu accessible from Settings page

3. Breadcrumbs (Optional):
   - Add breadcrumb navigation: "Dashboard > Settings"
   - Make "Dashboard" clickable to return home

4. Close Button (Alternative):
   - If Settings is modal-style, add X button in top right corner
   - Clicking closes settings and returns to dashboard

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
Add a header to the Settings page that includes:
- Left side: "← Back" button or clickable logo
- Center: "Settings" title
- Right side: User menu (if applicable)

Use React Router's useNavigate() hook to handle navigation:
- onClick: navigate('/dashboard') or navigate(-1) to go back

Make sure the navigation is consistent across all pages (Dashboard, Settings, Terms, Privacy, etc.)

## More Comprehensive Navigation Prompt

If you want to improve navigation throughout the app:
```
Improve navigation across the entire app:

1. PERSISTENT HEADER (all pages):
   - Logo/app name in top left (always clickable, goes to dashboard)
   - Main navigation links: Dashboard | Transactions | Budget | Reports
   - User menu in top right: Settings, Help, Logout

2. SETTINGS PAGE SPECIFIC:
   - Add "← Back to Dashboard" button above the settings content
   - Or add "Close" (X) button if settings feels modal-like
   - Breadcrumbs: Home > Settings

3. LEGAL PAGES (Terms, Privacy):
   - Add "← Back" button
   - Or show simplified header with logo and close button

4. ALL PAGES SHOULD:
   - Have a way to return to dashboard
   - Show current page indicator in navigation
   - Use React Router for proper navigation
   - Include keyboard shortcuts (ESC to close modals/settings)

5. MOBILE NAVIGATION:
   - Hamburger menu for navigation links
   - Back button always visible
   - Bottom navigation bar (optional) for key sections

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Create a reusable Header component
- Create a reusable PageHeader component for individual pages
- Use useNavigate() from react-router-dom for programmatic navigation
- Ensure all navigation is keyboard accessible

Make navigation intuitive and consistent across the entire app.
