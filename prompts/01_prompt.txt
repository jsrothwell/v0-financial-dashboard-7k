Create a personal finance dashboard based on the attached design mockup. 

Build this as a fully functional React component using:
- React with hooks (useState for demo data)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components where applicable
- Recharts for any charts/graphs

FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Display mock financial data (use realistic sample data)
- Make the dashboard responsive (mobile and desktop)
- Include interactive elements (clickable cards, hover states)
- Use a clean, modern color scheme that matches the design
- Ensure all numbers are properly formatted (currency, percentages)

KEY COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE:
1. Summary cards showing key metrics (total balance, monthly spending, etc.)
2. Visual charts for spending breakdown (pie/donut chart or bar chart)
3. Recent transactions list with categories
4. Budget progress indicators or bars
5. Any additional sections shown in the design

DATA STRUCTURE:
- Create sample transaction data with: amount, category, date, description
- Create sample budget data with: category, budgeted amount, spent amount
- Use realistic numbers and categories (groceries, rent, entertainment, etc.)

DESIGN NOTES:
- Follow the exact layout and spacing from the mockup
- Match colors, fonts, and component styles as closely as possible
- Add smooth transitions and hover effects
- Ensure proper visual hierarchy

Make this production-ready with clean, well-organized code.

## Tips for Using the Prompt

**1. Upload First, Then Prompt:**
- Drag your Figma screenshot into v0
- Then paste the prompt
- v0 works better when it can see the image while reading instructions

**2. If You Have Multiple Screenshots:**
```
I've attached 3 screenshots showing different states of the dashboard:
1. Desktop view (main dashboard)
2. Mobile view (responsive layout)  
3. Detailed view of the transactions section

Build a responsive dashboard that matches all these views. Focus on the desktop view first, then ensure mobile responsiveness.
